Watch this space. Cartridges for this project are a MUST HAVE, it was always part of the vision. A top loader like an Atari, SNES or Genesis etc. 

However, I am still brainstorming around, what that looks like. 

I did toy with the idea of using a micro:bit - but it feels expensive. I fear I will be stepping down a rabbit hole going custom though:
