One of the biggest constraints is the use of Micro Python. 

# Memory Allocation, MicroPython and the Heap

To some up one of the primary challenges of the Raspberry Pi Pico’s memory is [this article](https://forums.openmv.io/t/memory-allocation-error-at-startup-before-first-line-executed/7220/4)

Essentially the Pico has 2MB of Flash Storage, meaning you could theoretically store a 2MB Python file. However that code needs to be loaded into RAM before execution and the RAM is a fraction of that size. 

## Execution from the Heap

The **Pico W (CPU) on PicoVision has 264KB of SRAM**, which is where MicroPython runs and loads scripts. However, **not all of this is available for user scripts**, as MicroPython itself and system processes take up some memory.

### **Breakdown of RAM Availability**

- **Total RAM on RP2040 (Pico W CPU):** **264KB SRAM**
- **MicroPython Overhead:** Typically **~30-50KB** for the interpreter.
- **Usable for Python scripts & variables:** Around **200KB or less**, depending on what's running.
- **Frame buffers & GPU data: Thankfully these are s**tored in **external 2×8MB PSRAM**, **not in the main 264KB SRAM**.

### **Can This Be Expanded?**

- **No external RAM is available for MicroPython execution**—it runs strictly in **internal 264KB SRAM**.
- **Large Python scripts stored on an SD card are read into RAM** before execution, so available memory limits the script size.
- **Compiled C extensions could offload tasks** to free up RAM.

### **Potential Bottleneck**

- If your scripts become too large, you may **run out of RAM quickly**.
- Running **multiple Python modules at once** increases memory usage.
- **Sprites, game data, and large arrays** may require optimized memory use.

Would you like to explore **ways to optimize RAM usage**, or are you considering switching to a more memory-efficient approach like **compiled programs**?
